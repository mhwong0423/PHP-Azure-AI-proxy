# Azure OpenAI PHP Proxy

A lightweight PHP proxy that forward Azure OpenAI API responses.

Many OpenAI client libraries/SDKs only need a base_url change to use Azure — but some break due to small format differences (usage field location, model naming, error codes, etc.).

Making tweaks to this proxy so most software can treat it just like the official OpenAI API.
